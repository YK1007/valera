1. Find the app in Fdroid and download the apk & source code tarball. 
   Save them in the folder: ValeraClient/app/<appname>/

2. Use apktool to extrace the apk. Use this command:
        apktool d -s <apk_file>

   In the extraced folder, open the AndroidManifest.xml. Search 'package' 
   and 'MAIN' attribuate. For example, in the GhostCommander app, the package 
   name is "com.ghostsq.commander" and the main is "android:name='.FileCommander'".
   So the main entry is ".FileCommander".

   Create a config file "ValeraClient/app/<appname>/config.txt". Save the package and main entry 
   into this config file. Here is the template:
        PKG=com.ghostsq.commander
        MAIN=.FileCommander
        TRACING=0
        NETWORK_REPLAY=0
        APP_HOME_DIR=/data/data/$PKG

3. Install the app.
        adb install <apk_file>

4. Using EventRacer.
4.1 Go to EventRacer's folder and run the script: analyse_app.sh <apk_path>
    Run the app manually. Do not choose random exploration.
    *Remember: After you finish exploring the app, click 'Home' to go to the home page.

4.2 Create a testcase folder. e.g. "ValeraClient/app/<appname>/test1" and save ER_actionlog 
    into this folder.

5. Using Valera.
5.1 Start the emulator by running the script:
        cd Emualtor
        ./start_emulator_x86.sh

5.2 Make sure you're the root user.
        adb root

5.3 Start valera recording mode:
        script/run.sh --config app/<appname>/config.txt --blacklist template/blacklist.txt --cmd record
    Then follow the same click steps in EventRacer.
    *Remember: After you finish exploring the app, click 'Home' to go to the home page.
               Then click Ctrl-C once, valera will collect the data from the device.

5.4 The result is saved in "ValeraClient/result" folder. Make sure that 'inputevent.bin' and 'record.trace.z'
    are in "ValeraClient/result/valera/". Then save this 'result' folder to "ValeraClient/app/appname/test1".
